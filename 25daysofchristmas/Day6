ta Exfiltration Techniques

Data Exfiltration is the technique of transferring unauthorized data out of the network.

Easy way to detect is to look up at wireshark's logs to check if unauthorized data's are not leaked.

Advanced Persistant Threats, APT are harder to detect as they can be hidden deep inside abusing kerberos and its ticket granting system to gain permanent access.

**Note**: Kerberos is a computer-network authentication protocol that works on the basis of tickets to allow nodes communicating over a non-secure network to prove their identity to one another in a secure manner.

- DNS
- FTP / SFTP / SMB based file transfer
- HTTP / HTTPS
- Steganography
- ICMP

We can filter DNS queries using Wireshark, some hex data are transferred which can be converted to ascii using xxd 

Also since DNS was done maybe somethings were retrieved, http filter shows a zip file and a image file. They can be exported, from **file→export objects →http→file**

zipfile had a password, tools like fcrackzip can be used to crack password with a dictionary attack.

steghide can be used to extract information from files hidden.

```python
data exfiltrated: Candy Can Serial Number 8491
Timmy wanted to be: Pentester
Hidden in file: RFC527
```
