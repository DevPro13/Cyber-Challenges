	Unsecure data is used to abuse the logic of an application - RCE, DoS

Serialisation is the process of converting objects used in programming into simpler, compatible formatting for transmitting between systems or networks for further processing or storage.

Alternatively, deserialisation is the reverse of this; converting serialised information into their complex form - an object that the application will understand.
